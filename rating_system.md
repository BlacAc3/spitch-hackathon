This task requires creating a structured series of questions for rating a TTS system, incorporating a hidden competence assessment. The questions should be systematic and lead to a final, backend-calculated rating. Here is a proposed structure and the questions themselves, designed to be user-friendly while gathering the necessary data.

### **Yoruba TTS Proverb Evaluation Survey**

**Welcome to the Yoruba Proverb TTS Evaluation!**

Your feedback is crucial in helping us improve our text-to-speech technology. We will play a series of Yoruba proverbs generated by our TTS system. Please listen carefully and answer the questions for each one. Your responses will help us understand how well the system performs in different aspects.

### **Section 1: Initial Assessment (Competence Check)**

This section is designed to gauge your familiarity with the Yoruba language. Your answers here will help us weigh your feedback accordingly. Please answer truthfully.

**Question 1:**
* Yoruba is a tonal language. What does this mean in the context of spoken words?
    * A) It means the words are pronounced with varying loudness.
    * B) It means the pitch of a syllable can change the meaning of a word.
    * C) It means the speed at which words are spoken can change their meaning.
    * D) It means the words have a rhythmic pattern, like music.

**Question 2:**
* Consider the Yoruba words `ìyà` and `ìyá`. How do their meanings differ?
    * A) `ìyà` means 'mother' and `ìyá` means 'suffering'.

### **Section 2: Proverb Evaluation (Rating Questions)**

For each proverb, you will hear an audio clip. Please listen to the clip and then answer the questions that follow.

**Proverb 1: [Audio Clip of Proverb 1]**

**Question 4: Intelligibility (Word Clarity)**
* On a scale of 1 to 5, how clear and distinct were the individual words in the proverb?
    * 1 (Very unclear, difficult to understand)
    * 2 (Somewhat unclear)
    * 3 (Neutral)
    * 4 (Clear)
    * 5 (Very clear, all words are perfectly discernible)

**Question 5: Intelligibility (Segmentation)**
* Did the TTS system merge or split words unnaturally, making it sound disjointed?
    * A) Yes, words were merged or split unnaturally.
    * B) No, the flow between words was natural.

**Question 6: Tone Accuracy**
* How accurate were the tones (High, Mid, Low) in the proverb? Did any incorrect tones change the meaning of a word?
    * 1 (Completely inaccurate, meaning was lost or distorted)
    * 2 (Mostly inaccurate, several words had wrong tones)
    * 3 (Neutral)
    * 4 (Mostly accurate, minor tone errors)
    * 5 (Perfectly accurate, all tones were correct)

**Question 7: Naturalness (Fluency and Voice Quality)**
* How would you describe the overall sound of the voice?
    * A) It sounds very "machine-like" or robotic, with glitches or a stilted rhythm.
    * B) It sounds unnatural but understandable.
    * C) It has some natural qualities but still sounds synthetic.
    * D) It sounds very fluent and smooth, with a pleasant and natural voice quality.

**Question 8: Naturalness (Accent Authenticity)**
* Does the TTS pronunciation sound like a native Yoruba speaker?
    * A) No, it sounds like a foreign accent.
    * B) It sounds somewhat authentic, but with noticeable foreign influence.
    * C) Yes, it sounds like a native Yoruba speaker.

**Question 9: Semantic Correctness**
* Based on your understanding, did the TTS model's pronunciation retain the correct meaning of the proverb?
    * A) No, the meaning was significantly changed or lost.
    * B) The meaning was partially retained, but with errors.
    * C) Yes, the proverb's original meaning was perfectly preserved.

**Section 3: Overall Impression**

**Question 10: Overall Rating**
* Based on all the aspects you've evaluated (intelligibility, tone, naturalness), how would you rate the TTS system's performance on this proverb?
    * 1 (Very Poor)
    * 2 (Poor)
    * 3 (Fair)
    * 4 (Good)
    * 5 (Excellent)

### **System Logic for Backend Calculation:**

* **Competence Score:** The backend system will calculate a competence score based on the answers to Questions 1, 2, and 3.
    * Correct answer to Q1 (B), Q2 (B), and Q3 (D) will grant a high competence score (e.g., 1 point per correct answer).
    * A user with a score of 3/3 will be considered an "Expert" and their ratings will be given a high weighting (e.g., 1.5x importance).
    * A user with a score of 2/3 will be "Knowledgeable" and their ratings will have a standard weighting (e.g., 1.0x importance).
    * A user with a score of 0-1/3 will be a "Novice" and their ratings will be given a lower weighting (e.g., 0.5x importance), as their feedback may be less reliable for nuanced linguistic aspects.

* **Final Proverb Rating:** For each proverb, the final rating will be a weighted average of the user's responses.
    * The ratings from Questions 4, 6, and 10 will be the primary inputs.
    * The `Competence Score` will act as a multiplier on these ratings.
    * For example: `Final Rating = ( (Q4 + Q6 + Q10) / 3 ) * Competence_Multiplier`
    * The system can also be designed to give higher importance to `Tone Accuracy` (Q6) and `Intelligibility` (Q4) for a more technical evaluation.

This structure allows for a systematic collection of feedback, a hidden competence check to filter for high-quality data, and a clear path for the backend system to calculate a nuanced and trustworthy final rating.
